# Bayesian Network Construction using `sparsebn` and `bnlearn`

Welcome to the Bayesian Network Construction repository! This repository contains scripts and documentation for constructing Bayesian networks using the `sparsebn` and `bnlearn` R packages. The purpose of this project is to provide a step-by-step guide for building and analyzing Bayesian networks, which are powerful probabilistic graphical models used for modeling dependencies among variables.

## Introduction

Bayesian networks are graphical models that represent probabilistic relationships among variables through a directed acyclic graph (DAG). They have applications in various fields such as machine learning, genetics, finance, and more. This repository aims to demonstrate how to construct Bayesian networks using the `sparsebn` and `bnlearn` R packages and how to interpret the results.

## Dependencies

Before running the Bayesian network construction pipeline, make sure you have the following dependencies installed on your system:

- R (version >= 3.2.3): A programming language for statistical computing and graphics.
- `sparsebn` package (version 0.0.5): A package for building sparse Bayesian networks.
- `bnlearn` package (version 4.8.3): A comprehensive package for Bayesian network learning and inference.

Please ensure you have the correct versions of these packages installed.

## Data

The data used for constructing the Bayesian network is not included in this repository. You are expected to provide your own data in the appropriate format. The data should be structured in a way that represents the variables and their relationships.

## Bayesian Network Construction Workflow

The Bayesian network construction can be divided into several steps:

1. **Data Preparation**: Prepare the data in the required format for building the Bayesian network.
2. **Structure Learning**: Use the `bnlearn` package to learn the structure of the Bayesian network from the data.
3. **Parameter Learning**: Estimate the parameters of the Bayesian network using the available data.
4. **Model Assessment**: Evaluate the performance of the learned Bayesian network using various metrics.

## Usage

To construct a Bayesian network using the `sparsebn` and `bnlearn` packages, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/abhijitswain09/Construction-of-bayesian-network-using-sparsebn-and-bnlearn.git`
2. Prepare your data in the appropriate format and place it in the data directory.
3. Install the required dependencies listed in the "Dependencies" section.
4. Modify the configuration file if necessary to specify specific parameters or options.
5. Execute the Bayesian network construction script: `Rscript sparsebn.R`, `Rscript bnlearn.R`.
6. The resulting Bayesian network model and evaluation metrics will be stored in the output directory.

## Results

The results of the Bayesian network construction process will be stored in the output directory. This will include the learned Bayesian network structure, estimated parameters, and various evaluation metrics. Additionally, visual representations of the Bayesian network may be generated for better understanding.
